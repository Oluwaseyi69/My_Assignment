//2.15 (Arithmetic) Write an application that asks the user to enter two integers, obtains them from
the user and prints the square of each, the sum of their squares, and the difference of the squares (first
number squared minus the second number squared). Use the techniques shown in Fig. 2.7.
2.16 (Comparing Integers) Write an application that asks the user to enter one integer, obtains
it from the user and displays whether the number and its square are greater than, equal to, not equal
to, or less than the number 100. Use the techniques shown in Fig. 2.15.
2.17 (Arithmetic, Smallest and Largest) Write an application that inputs three integers from the
user and displays the sum, average, product, smallest and largest of the numbers. Use the techniques
shown in Fig. 2.15. [Note: The calculation of the average in this exercise should result in an integer
representation of the average. So, if the sum of the values is 7, the average should be 2, not
2.3333â€¦.]
2.18 (Displaying Shapes with Asterisks) Write an application that displays a box, an oval, an ar-
row and a diamond using asterisks (*), as follows:
